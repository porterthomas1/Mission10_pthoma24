This ASP.net project creates an online bookstore with session implementation, allowing users to access a cart that keeps track of all the books they've added. This cart automatically calculates totals and allows for users to delete books from their cart. A checkout option is also provided, upon which a user will enter their information for checkout. A validation method is implemented here to only let users proceed upon successful submission of valid information.

*Note: ASP app will not view properly with github (See screenshots below for website preview)
